First Access:
-------------

The First time you have to call the delightCMS by the following URL:

 http://www.YOURDOMAIN.dom/de/1/adm=1

Use the Username `admin` and the Password `cmsadmin` to get access.

Now create all your menus and contents. After go to the administration page `Publish Pages` and create the pages for the first Language. After your Page is visible to your Customers and you can Login as usual by the yellow padlock.

*ATTENTION:* You always need a `home` Shortlink in your Menu. Even as the main shortlink or the translated one.

*Note:* In some circumstances you will have the language `german (de)` twice. In this case, just Login into your Administration Panel from your hosting provider and choose `PHPMyAdmin`. There navigate to the table `dhp_languages` and remove the second row which stays for `german (de)`.
